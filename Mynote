If you meet the problem "libgfortran.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", you may try 

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-7 g++-7
gcc-7 --version
sudo apt-get install gfortran-7
this works on ubutu16

awk '{print > $1".txt"}' file1 #to print every row to diffrent files based on the first colum.
awk '{if($2<=500)print > "500L.txt";else print > "500G.txt"}' file1 #to print every row to diffrent files based on the second colum.
