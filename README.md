#############

format_gd.csv_envpop_V1.sh generate a metadata incuding mutation infomation and population infomration;

detect_parallel.sh generate the parallel number for each gene in each strains;

create_APmatrix_copyformat_v2.sh generate the matrix of parallel mutation with copy nmuber information; also need total.prGO file

#############

The scripts with AAconv are for convegent mutations at nucletides level

#############

auto_createAPmatrix can generate the matrix for convergent genes
